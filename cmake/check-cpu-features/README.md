By running `check-cpu-features`, it outputs the LLVM LLC accepted command line that should include all features the current host has.

For example: 
```
-mcpu=neoverse-n1 -mtriple=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu -mattr="+fp-armv8,+lse,+neon,+crc,+crypto"
```

Be careful when using this with a simulator, as not all modern instructions are supported. 
For example, many simulators do not support AVX. 
If your simulator falls into this category, make sure to remove the feature here. 
You can disable a feature using a minus sign, for example: ```-mattr="-avx"```
